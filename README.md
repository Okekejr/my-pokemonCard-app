## Description:

> - My PokemonCards is a full-stack app that uses an in-built server and Postgres database provided by Vercel for deployment about my-pokemonCard-API. The PokemonCards app fetches the Pokemon from the Vercel Postgres database and renders a list of Pokemon available, on the gallery page in which each Pokemon has a card that includes names, descriptions, images, etc. It also gives you the feature to delete a Pokemon and add Pokemon cards to the list on the Add Pokemon page.
